# TheOffice

"The Office" is a task management website using ASP.NET (with C# and Razor), designed to streamline project management
and boost productivity. The website takes inspiration from the TV show of the same name and offers a user-friendly interface
for creating, assigning, and managing tasks. Users can easily form teams and assign members to tasks, track progress, and
receive feedback, promoting effective communication and collaboration. Additionally, we included an authentication system
that provides users with secure access to their tasks and team assignments. This project allowed me to showcase my
problem-solving skills, collaborate effectively in a team setting, and develop a practical solution that can benefit individuals
and teams looking to manage tasks efficiently.
